## Flask:  

First time local development set up:

1)
`cd flask/`  
`python3 -m venv env`  
`cd ..`  
`pip3 install autoenv==1.0.0`  
``echo "source `which activate.sh`" >> ~/.bashrc``
`source ~/.bashrc`

3) create PSQL DB called "photo2code_dev"

4) Run dev server  
`cd flask/`  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
Set Google Client Id/Secret environment variable (See section below).  
`python3 manage.py db upgrade`  
`flask run`  


To manually activate the virtual environment:
`source env/bin/activate`  

## Docker:  
Build services:
`docker-compose build`

Start the containers:
`docker-compose up`

To build and start containers:
`docker-compose up -d --build`

Remove containers and network:
 `docker-compose down -v`

## Set environmental variables

Linux bash or Mac OS X:   
`export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id`  
`export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_id`
`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"`

Windows:  
`set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id`  


## React

`cd react-app`
`npm install`
`npm start`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
